Tommorrow

Write code that shrinks/grows trash based on data

Find data, hook in data

Monday - Thurs over flow, bug fixes, demo, any minor improvements, make growing/shrinking nicer ooking.

Then done.

Ideally for some like metal and such, increase the barrel count instead of just increasing the size!
